Thinking of contributing to the Working Open Workshop? That's great! We'd love to have you.

We value the participation of all contributors. To help maintain a welcoming and safe atmosphere online and at our events we have a code of conduct in place. Make sure you read it.

The simplest way you can join in with this repo is to:

* file new issues or make pull requests if you notice problems, typos or bugs
* read the existing issues and contribute your expertise in whatever way makes sense

If you're unsure of how to get involved, feel free to ask us directly on twitter: [@mozillascience](https://twitter.com/mozillascience).

We don't yet have a full contributing guide in place for this repo - if you want to help us improve this please do open an issue.
